    "## Proposed Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Enhance Dataset\n",
    "- Annotate additional examples, focusing on a variety of contexts and sentence structures.\n",
    "- Use synthetic data generation (e.g., GPT-based tools) to augment the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Model Enhancements\n",
    "- Fine-tune a domain-specific BERT model or explore alternatives like RoBERTa or T5 for NER.\n",
    "- Incorporate CRF or similar techniques to improve sequence labeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Data Augmentation\n",
    "- Use contextual augmentation (e.g., replacing words in sentences with synonyms or adding new examples with similar contexts).\n",
    "- Include negative examples to teach the model to distinguish mountains from non-mountain entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Hyperparameter Optimization\n",
    "- Conduct experiments to optimize learning rates, batch sizes, and the number of epochs.\n",
    "- Implement cross-validation for robust evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Post-Processing\n",
    "- Develop rules or heuristics to filter out invalid mountain names post-inference.\n",
    "- Use external geographic databases to validate detected entities.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Conclusion and Next Steps\n",
    "The current model faces challenges in detecting mountain names due to dataset quality, model architecture, and token-label alignment issues. By addressing these challenges and implementing the recommended improvements, the solution's performance can be significantly enhanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Immediate Actions\n",
    "1. Re-annotate the dataset to improve quality.\n",
    "2. Incorporate domain-specific models and evaluate their performance.\n",
    "3. Conduct thorough error analysis to identify critical weaknesses in the pipeline."
